# Compound Interest Calculator

## Overview
The **Compound Interest Calculator** is a web application that helps users calculate compound interest on their investments or savings. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency to get an accurate calculation.

## Features
- User-friendly interface
- Calculates compound interest based on user input
- Supports multiple compounding frequencies (daily, monthly, quarterly, annually)
- Instant result display
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop users

## How It Works
1. Enter the **Principal Amount** (Initial Investment)
2. Input the **Annual Interest Rate** (in percentage)
3. Choose the **Compounding Frequency** (Daily, Monthly, Quarterly, Annually)
4. Enter the **Time Period** (in years)
5. Click the **Calculate** button to get the final amount and interest earned

## Formula Used
The compound interest is calculated using the formula:
\[ A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]
Where:
- **A** = Final amount after interest
- **P** = Principal amount
- **r** = Annual interest rate (decimal form)
- **n** = Number of times interest is compounded per year
- **t** = Time period (in years)

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** - Structure of the web page
- **CSS** - Styling and layout
- **JavaScript** - Logic for calculations and interactivity
